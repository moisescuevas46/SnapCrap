## SnapCrap

# Proposal
SnapCrap is a mobile joke app that several people can use as a (anti) social network. The purpose of the app is to respond to all the kinds of social networks on the internet by making fun of the people who takes hundreds of unnecessary photos to people of themselves food and just random things. Why make an app like this? because that's just one more thing people need to know right??

# Behind the app
To create this social media app we used a tablet to test the app and android studio on the laptop to create the app. We used the following coding languages in order to create the app: HTML, CSS, and Java.

However we did run into several problems while developing the app which severely slowed down progress. The database to store the login and register information refused to work right along with several android studio problems that and physical computer issues that would not allow us to test and/or proceed on schedule. In order to overcome these issues we did create a series of temporary fixes so we could continue and tackle the issue at a later time.

# Final Product
Features:
Camera functionality
Menu to jump across features at ease
Have access to the photos taken
Login and Register

Currently, SnapCrap can take pictures and store them in the app and even though there is no database to create new accounts you can still login and register users. The app can also navigate between features through the menu.

# Implementations for the future
Some features we were not able to get to due to the constant errors and computer setbacks that slowed down progress of theproject. However we will definitely implement new and better features in the future like the ability for two mobile devices communicate between each other. Adding a like and follow system between profiles and the ability to customize profiles. Another key feature we would have liked to add if it wasn't for the constant issues would be filters for the camera so you can edit the photos taken. One last feature we would have added would have been the notification system for followers can be notified when there is a new post in SnapCrap.
