## SnapCrap

# Proposal
SnapCrap is a mobile joke app that several people can use as a (anti) social network. The purpose of the app is to respond to all the kinds of social networks on the internet by making fun of the people who takes hundreds of unnecessary photos to people of themselves food and just random things. Why make an app like this? because that's just one more thing people need to know right?? 

# Behind the app
To create this social media app we used a tablet to test the app and android studio on the laptop to create the app. We used the following coding languages in order to create the app: HTML, CSS, and Java.

However we did run into several problems while developing the app which severely slowed down progress. The database to store the login and register information refused to work right along with several android studio problems that and physical computer issues that would not allow us to test and/or proceed on schedule. In order to overcome these issues we did create a series of temporary fixes so we could continue and tackle the issue at a later time.
